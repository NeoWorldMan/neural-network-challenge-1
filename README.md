# Student Loans Recommendation System with Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **deep learning-based recommendation system** for student loan options. The notebook demonstrates the use of neural networks to analyze student profiles, loan attributes, and contextual information to generate personalized loan recommendations.

---

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a neural network architecture to handle complex, non-linear relationships between student data and loan recommendations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing student and loan datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful features from the input data, such as student demographics, loan preferences, and financial needs.
- **Training and Validation**: Implements a pipeline for training the model on labeled data and evaluating its performance.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Outputs customized loan suggestions based on user input.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NeoWorldMan/neural-network-challenge-1.git
   cd neural-network-challenge-1
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Place the student and loan datasets in the appropriate location as described in the notebook.
   - Ensure datasets are in CSV format with clearly defined column names.

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   Execute all cells in order to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate recommendations.

5. **Input Student Data**:
   Provide sample student profiles as input to the model for testing personalized recommendations.
